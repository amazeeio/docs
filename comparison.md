# Comparison of amazee.io, Pantheon, Acquia Cloud, Platform.sh

We’ve put together this chart to help highlight the differences between industry vendors with the intention of providing clarity and a fair comparison of real service offerings. This project is not intended as critique -- we like our competitors and they do outstanding work!

Help improve our documentation! If you find anything wrong or which could be improved in our chart, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/amazeeio/docs/blob/master/comparison.md) to our GitHub repository.
