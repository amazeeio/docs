## Try this first

For most problems with the Docker Development environment, it's the best to restart all shared and Drupal specific Docker containers.

### Restart shared Docker containers

This is done either in `pygmy` or `cachalot`

    $ amazeeio-cachalot restart       
or

    $ pygmy restart -d       

now you should also restart the Drupal specific Containers:

### Restart Drupal Containers

needs to be done separate for each Drupal container. Run this command where the `docker-compose.yml` is:

    $ docker-compose restart
        
sometimes this is not enough, we can tell docker compose to recreate the containers:

    $ docker-compose up -d --force-recreate

If this still is not enough, this is the 🔨  method:

    $ docker-compose down -v
    $ docker-compose up

{% hint style='danger' %}
This will remove your whole local MySQL database and maybe existing other local created volumes (like the solr search index).
{% endhint %}

## Drupal Container logs

The above commands all assume that something is wrong with the containers, sometimes though the issue lies somewhere else.  
To find such issues, we need to analyze the docker logs, do that via:

    $ docker-compose logs

## Shared container logs

To see the logs of the shared container started via `pygmy` or `cachalot`, first display all docker containers:

    $ docker ps
    
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
    9e27b9eadc67        amazeeio/drupal:php70-basic   "/sbin/my_init"          5 minutes ago       Up 5 minutes        80/tcp, 443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32782->3306/tcp   amazee_io.docker.amazee.io
    5ce655cd369f        andyshinn/dnsmasq:2.75        "dnsmasq -k -A /docke"   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       0.0.0.0:53->53/tcp, 0.0.0.0:53->53/udp     amazeeio-dnsmasq
    124b3919e89a        amazeeio/ssh-agent            "/run.sh ssh-agent"      24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes                                                  amazeeio-ssh-agent
    93eb7a384640        amazeeio/haproxy              "/app/docker-entrypoi"   24 minutes ago      Up 24 minutes       0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, 0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp   amazeeio-haproxy

You can see three containers that have names with starting `amazeeio-` these are the shared containers.

You can view each container's logs via:

    $ docker logs -f [container name]
    
Btw, you can also see the logs of the Drupal Containers, via that command.

## I get an error like `Conflict. The name "/amazee_io.docker.amazee.io" is already in use by container`

It happened to all of us, you remove a local `docker-compose.yml` file, recreate it and now during `docker-compose up -d`, docker yells at you and tells you this container exists already.

The easiest way would be to just give your new container another name, but there are better ways:

## Remove a container

1. Find the name of the container you would like to completely remove via:

        $ docker ps
        
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                         COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                      NAMES
        9e27b9eadc67        amazeeio/drupal:php70-basic   "/sbin/my_init"          10 minutes ago      Up 10 minutes       80/tcp, 443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:32782->3306/tcp   amazee_io.docker.amazee.io

2. Stop the container

        $ docker stop amazee_io.docker.amazee.io
        
3. Remove the container with it's volumes:

        $ docker rm -v amazee_io.docker.amazee.io

## Remove all containers and all volumes

You shouldn't really need to do this, and if you think so, first try the above help. But sometimes the best way is to completely restart:

    $ docker rm -vf $(docker ps -q)
    
This will stop and remove all containers and all attached volumes.

{% hint style='danger' %}
This will remove your whole local MySQL database and maybe existing other local created volumes (like the solr search index).
{% endhint %}


But sometimes we might have some old volumes that we don't need anymore, you can also get rid of them:

    $ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q)

Now you have a completely empty Docker, now it's time to start again with `pygmy` or `cachalot`.

## I get an error like `Service "drupal" mounts volumes from "amazeeio-ssh-agent", which is not the name of a service or container.`

This can happen when you start a Drupal Container via `docker-compose up -d`

    $ docker-compose up -d
    ERROR: Service "drupal" mounts volumes from "amazeeio-ssh-agent", which is not the name of a service or container.

The Drupal Containers are depending on the `ssh-agent` shared Docker container (this is in order to have shared ssh-keys) and somehow this container is missing.

You should try to restart either `pygmy` or `cachalot`, which will create the `ssh-agent` container with the name `amazeeio-ssh-agent` and then try again.
