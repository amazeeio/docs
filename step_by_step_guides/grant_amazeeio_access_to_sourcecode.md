## Other / Generic Git Hosting
You're using a private installation of Gitlab, AWS Git repositories or something else we didn't come up with yet?

No worries, we only need read access on the repository so we will provide you with a SSH Public-Key which then needs to be granted access.

Feel free to get in touch with us on slack or via `support@amazee.io` and we help you getting the repository access in line.
